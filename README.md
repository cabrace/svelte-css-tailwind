# Learning CSS and Tailwind

## Reasons

The reason and purpose behind this repo is to be a collaborative effort to LEARN CSS,tailwind,javascript,svelte,
separating 'what we think we know' from 'what we actually know' and add to that by DOING.

## Overview / Outline

Currently the `/src/routes/*` folder has two main folders `cb` and `mr` which represent two contributors for the project.
Each contributor will break their folders and structures up accordingly as they need, and all projects are to be listed
on the front index page. i.e site root.
